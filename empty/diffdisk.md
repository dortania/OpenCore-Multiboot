# Dualbooting on different disks

I will not get too long in this part as it's the EASIEST one:

* Install macOS on one of the disks
* Install $(SECONDOS) on the other disk
* Install/copy OpenCore on the macOS disk EFI
* You're good to go

Things to keep in mind:

- Windows can be a bitch when it comes to multidisk setups (it freaks out when it sees a lot of EFI partitions on a lot of disks)
- If the above happens, disable/disconnect all the other disks and install windows as you would normally do
  - For laptops this can be a pain, you can install windows manually by following [this guide from TenForums](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/84331-apply-windows-image-using-dism-instead-clean-install.html)
  - Make sure you choose the proper disk
- Install Windows and install macOS, it works *quite* well
- You can still refer to other situations if you want to dualboot more than one OS on one of the disks.
- Make sure that OpenCore is on the same disk of macOS for easier troubleshooting and cleaner setup

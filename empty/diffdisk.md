# Dualbooting on different disks

I will not get too long in this part as it's the EASIEST one:

* Install macOS on one of the disks
* Install `[OtherOS]` on the other disk
* Install/copy OpenCore on the macOS disk EFI
* You're good to go

Things to keep in mind:

* If you have issues, please see the [troubleshooting section](../troubleshooting.md)
* You can still refer to other situations if you want to dualboot more than one OS on one of the disks.
* Make sure that OpenCore is on the same disk of macOS for easier troubleshooting and cleaner setup
